1. Introduction

The theoretical basis of learning from examples relies on the possibility
of bounding the generalization error, which is the probability that
the trained machine makes an error on a new pattern. However, the
rigorous bounds deduced with methods of statistical theory (Vapnik,
1995), which hold for the worst case, turn out to be too pessimistic
in most real world applications. Bounds to the estimator of the generalization error, obtained by the leave-one-out technique, are closer
to experimental results (Vapnik and Chapelle, 2000). This estimator
is obtained through averaging the classiﬁcation error on one pattern,
when learning was achieved by removing that pattern from the training
set. Another approach to learning theory, heralded more than a decade
ago by the pioneering work of E. Gardner on perceptrons (Gardner and
Derrida, 1988), strives to determine analytically the typical properties
of the learning machine under somewhat restrictive hypothesis. This is
done using methods from Statistical Physics, developed to study the
properties of large, disordered physical systems. The basic assumption
of this approach is that average quantities are representative of the
machine’s properties, with a probability that tends to the unity as the
system’s size goes to inﬁnity, a limit usually called the thermodynamic
(TD) limit. Thus, in this limit, the leave-one-out estimators and the
Statistical Mechanics results are expected to converge to the same values. The input patterns distribution plays the role of the disorder over
which averages are taken, the size of the system being the input space
dimension. In the TD limit, some control parameters, like the training

set size relative to the input space dimension, are kept ﬁxed. This
enables to deduce typical properties for small relative training set sizes,
in contrast to the bounds provided by the statistical theories, which are
generally valid for suﬃciently large training sets. In this paper we are
able to get deeper insight on the typical properties of Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) by also keeping ﬁxed other characteristic quantities.
The typical properties of polynomial SVMs have been studied in two
recent papers (Dietrich et al., 1999; Buhot and Gordon, 1999). Both
n are mapped onto
consider SVMs in which the input vectors x ∈ ℜ
quadratic features Φ using the normalized mapping (Dietrich et al.,
1999)

respectively. The latter was studied as a function of k, the number of
quadratic features. For k = n the dimension of both feature spaces is
the same. They correspond to the quadratic kernels

(2)

K(x, y) = x · y (1 + a x · y),
with a = 1/√n for ΦN and a = 1 for ΦN N . In spite of the seemingly
innocuous diﬀerences between the models, their properties are very
diﬀerent.

(3)

If the rule to be learned is a linear separation in input space, the generalization error ǫg corresponding to the non-normalized mapping ΦN N
is much larger than the Maximal Margin Hyperplane (MMH) solution
of a simple perceptron in input space (i.e. with no added features). The
latter corresponds to a linear SVM, which is the smallest SVM able to
generalize this rule. This diﬀerence between the quadratic and the linear
SVMs increases dramatically with k, the number of quadratic features
included. On the other hand, the generalization error corresponding to
the normalized mapping ΦN is only slightly larger than that of the
simple MMH perceptron. In the case of learning quadratic separations,
the generalization error ǫg of the normalized mapping exhibits a very
interesting behaviour (Dietrich et al., 1999; Yoon and Oh, 1998): if
the number of training patterns scales with n, the dimension of the
linear subspace, ǫg decreases up to a ﬁnite asymptotic lower bound,
and it only vanishes asymptotically if the number of patterns scales
proportionally to n2. The generalization error of higher order polynomial SVMs using the normalized mapping also presents diﬀerent scaling
regimes (Dietrich et al., 1999).

In order to understand these results, it is useful to consider the
feature space of the polynomial SVMs as the direct product of several
subspaces, each one spanned by all the monomials (of the same degree)
that can be formed with the input components. The number of subspaces is given by the degree of the polynomial. The dimension of each
subspace, equal to the number of diﬀerent monomials, grows polynomially with n, the input space dimension. For example, in quadratic
SVM’s there are two subspaces, one corresponding to the n linear
features and the other to the n2 quadratic features. In the case of the
normalized mapping, if the training set size scales with the dimension of
one particular subspace, only the features belonging to this and to the
lower order subspaces contribute eﬀectively to learning (Dietrich et al.,
1999). As a result, the generalization error decreases asymptotically to
a lower bound. The latter is smaller the higher the particular subspace
dimension, and goes to zero when the number of training patterns is
proportional to the dimension of the highest dimensional subspace. We
call this behaviour hierarchical learning.

The only diﬀerence between the mappings ΦN and ΦN N is that
the quadratic features in ΦN are squeezed by a factor a = 1/√n with
respect to those of ΦN N . This normalization is very sensitive to the TD
limit. In particular, at ﬁnite n, the hierarchical learning behaviour of
the generalization error, sharply deﬁned in the TD limit, is expected to
give raise to crossovers between successive regimes as a function of the
number of training patterns, in which features belonging to increasingly
higher order subspaces are learned.

The aim of the present paper is to clarify to what extent the qualitative diﬀerences between the normalized and the non-normalized mappings are still present in polynomial SVMs working in ﬁnite dimension,
and to characterize the signature of the hierarchical learning. Within
our approach, given the input space dimension n and the mapping,
the polynomial SVM is characterized by two kinds of quantities, the
inﬂation factor and the feature’s variance in each subspace. The former is given by the corresponding subspace dimension relative to the
input space dimension. The latter is proportional to the normalizing
factor a; depending on its value, the features distribution may be highly
anisotropic in the sense that in diﬀerent subspaces the corresponding
features have diﬀerent variances.

Using the tools of Statistical Mechanics, we determine the typical
properties of SVMs of ﬁnite inﬂation factors and features variances, as
a function of α ≡ ℓ/n, where ℓ is the the number of training patterns.
This is diﬀerent from the approaches of (Dietrich et al., 1999; Yoon
and Oh, 1998) who considered separately two diﬀerent scalings for ℓ,
namely ℓ ∝ n and ℓ ∝ n2. Our results give some insight on the inner

workings of ﬁnite SVMs, given their inﬂation factors and variances. The
diﬀerent scaling regimes of the generalization error as a function of α
become a crossover, as expected, but more interestingly, its steepness
depends not only on the particular SVM considered, but also on the
complexity of the rule to be learnt. The previous results (Dietrich et
al., 1999; Buhot and Gordon, 1999) are recovered by performing the
suitable limits. Our analytical results are supported by the excellent
agreement with the numerical simulations.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we present
our model. A short introduction to the Statistical Mechanics approach,
with its application to our analysis of the quadratic SVMs is presented
in section 3, the details being left to the Appendix. The analytic predictions are described and compared with numerical simulations in 4.
The results are discussed and generalized in section 5. The conclusion
is left to section 6.

K(x, y) = x · y (1 + a x · y),

If the rule to be learned is a linear separation in input space, the generalization error ǫg corresponding to the non-normalized mapping ΦN N
is much larger than the Maximal Margin Hyperplane (MMH) solution
of a simple perceptron in input space (i.e. with no added features). The
latter corresponds to a linear SVM, which is the smallest SVM able to

the generalization error ǫg of the normalized mapping exhibits a very

the number of training patterns scales with n, the dimension of the

and it only vanishes asymptotically if the number of patterns scales
proportionally to n2. The generalization error of higher order polynomial SVMs using the normalized mapping also presents diﬀerent scaling
regimes (Dietrich et al., 1999).

In order to understand these results, it is useful to consider the
feature space of the polynomial SVMs as the direct product of several
subspaces, each one spanned by all the monomials (of the same degree)
that can be formed with the input components. The number of subspaces is given by the degree of the polynomial. The dimension of each
subspace, equal to the number of diﬀerent monomials, grows polynomially with n, the input space dimension. For example, in quadratic
SVM’s there are two subspaces, one corresponding to the n linear
features and the other to the n2 quadratic features. In the case of the
normalized mapping, if the training set size scales with the dimension of
one particular subspace, only the features belonging to this and to the
lower order subspaces contribute eﬀectively to learning (Dietrich et al.,
1999). As a result, the generalization error decreases asymptotically to
a lower bound. The latter is smaller the higher the particular subspace
dimension, and goes to zero when the number of training patterns is
proportional to the dimension of the highest dimensional subspace. We
call this behaviour hierarchical learning.

The only diﬀerence between the mappings ΦN and ΦN N is that
the quadratic features in ΦN are squeezed by a factor a = 1/√n with
respect to those of ΦN N . This normalization is very sensitive to the TD
limit. In particular, at ﬁnite n, the hierarchical learning behaviour of
the generalization error, sharply deﬁned in the TD limit, is expected to
give raise to crossovers between successive regimes as a function of the
number of training patterns, in which features belonging to increasingly
higher order subspaces are learned.

The aim of the present paper is to clarify to what extent the qualitative diﬀerences between the normalized and the non-normalized mappings are still present in polynomial SVMs working in ﬁnite dimension,
and to characterize the signature of the hierarchical learning. Within

a function of α ≡ ℓ/n, where ℓ is the the number of training patterns.
This is diﬀerent from the approaches of (Dietrich et al., 1999; Yoon

2. The Model

We consider the problem of learning a binary classiﬁcation task from
examples with a SVM in polynomial feature spaces. The learning set
contains ℓ patterns (xi, yi) (i = 1, · · · , ℓ) where xi is an input vector in
the n-dimensional input space, and yi ∈ {−1, 1} is its class. We assume
that the components xiν (ν = 1, · · · , n) are independent identically
distributed gaussian random variables conveniently standardized, so
that they have zero-mean and unit variance:

n

These input vectors are mapped to a higher dimensional space (the feature space) wherein the machine looks for the MMH. In the following we
concentrate on quadratic feature spaces, although our conclusions are
more general, and may be applied to higher order polynomial SVMs, as
discussed in section 5. The mappings ΦN N (x) = (x, x1x, x2x, · · · , xnx)
and ΦN (x) = (x, x1x/√n, x2x/√n, · · · , xnx/√n) are particular instances of mappings of the form Φ(x) = (φ1, · · · , φn, φ11, φ12, · · · , φnn)
with φν = xν, and φνµ = a xν xµ. a is the normalizing factor of the
quadratic components: a = 1 for mapping ΦN N and a = 1/√n for ΦN .

Clearly, the components of Φ are not independent random variables.
For example, a number O(n3) of triplets of the form φνµφµτ φτ ν have
positive correlations. These contribute to the third order moments,
which should vanish if the features were gaussian. Moreover, the fourth
order connected correlations (Monasson, 1993) do not vanish in the
thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, in the following we will neglect
these and higher order connected moments. This approximation, used
in (Buhot and Gordon, 1999) and implicit in (Dietrich et al., 1999),
is equivalent to assuming that all the components in feature space are
independent gaussian variables. Then, the only diﬀerence between the
mappings ΦN and ΦN N lies in the variance of the quadratic components distribution. The results obtained using this simpliﬁcation are
in excellent agreement with the numerical tests described in the next
section.

Since, due to the symmetry of the transformation, only n(n + 1)/2
among the n2 quadratic features are diﬀerent, hereafter we restrict
the feature space and only consider the non redundant components,
that we denote z = (zu, zσ). The ﬁrst n components zu = (z1, · · · , zn)
hereafter called u-components, represent the original input pattern of
unit variance, lying in the linear subspace of the feature space. The
remaining components zσ = (zn+1, · · · , z˜n) stand for the non redundant
quadratic features, of variance σ, hereafter called σ-components. ˜n =
n(1 + ∆) is the dimension of the restricted feature space, where the
inﬂation ratio ∆ is the relative number of non-redundant quadratic
features per input space dimension. The quadratic mapping has ∆ =
(n + 1)/2.

According to the preceding discussion, we assume that learning ndimensional patterns selected with the isotropic distribution (4) with
a quadratic SVM is equivalent to learning the MMH with a simple
perceptron in an ˜n-dimensional space where the patterns are drawn
using the following anisotropic distribution,

3. Statistical Mechanics

Statistical Mechanics is the branch of Physics that deals with the properties of systems with many degrees of freedom, characterized by their
energy. In our case, this is the cost function E(w; Lℓ). It depends on
˜n, whose ˜n = n(1 + ∆) components are the system’s
the weights w ∈ ℜ
degrees of freedom, and on the set of training patterns Lℓ, which are
random variables selected with distribution (6). The equilibrium properties at temperature T ≡ β−1 are deduced through averages over the
Gibbs distribution:

1

Pβ(w; Lℓ) =

Zβ(Lℓ) exp(−βE(w; Lℓ)),

(9)

Zβ(Lℓ) is a normalization constant called partition function, deﬁned
through

Zβ(Lℓ) =

exp[−βE(w; Lℓ)] p(w) dw,

(10)

Z

where p(w) dw is a measure in the weights’ space. When β is very large,
only weights w with energies close to the minimum have signiﬁcant
probability, and contribute to the the integral in (10). In the limit β →
∞, only those that have minimal energy have non-vanishing probability.
The fraction of training errors corresponding to the minimal cost,
or any other intensive property of the system, may be deduced from
the so called free energy fβ(Lℓ) ≡ − ln Zβ(Lℓ)/(βn) (or through its
derivatives with respect to β), in the limit β → ∞. These quantities
are random variables, as they depend on the realization of Lℓ. In the
TD limit n → ∞, their variance is expected to vanish like 1/√n, which
means that all the training sets of the same size are expected to endow
the system with the same intensive typical properties with probability
one. This hypothesis, supported in particular by the good agreement
between the predictions and the simulations on perceptrons, has been
recently shown to hold on theoretical grounds, at least for some quantities (Talagrand, 1998). As fβ(Lℓ) is equal with probability 1 for all
the training sets, we can get rid of the dependance on Lℓ by taking
mean values over all the possible training sets. This non-trivial average
is done using a sophisticated technique, known as the replica trick,

developed for the study of disordered magnetic systems (M´ezard et al.,
1987), which uses the identity:

ln Z = limm→0

Z m

− 1
m

(11)

where the overline stands for the average over the training sets. The average of ln Z has been transformed into that of averaging the partition
functions of m replicated systems. In order to obtain non-trivial results,
one takes also ℓ → ∞ with the number of patterns per input space
dimension α ≡ ℓ/n constant. If we want to compare the results given
by this approach with the corresponding quantities of ﬁnite machines,
α is a relevant parameter.

This formalism has been succesfully applied to the analysis of neural
networks (Gardner and Derrida, 1988; Seung et al., 1992; Watkin et al.,
1993). In particular, an interesting property is the generalization error
of the trained machine, which in principle depends on the training set.
The above assumptions amount to saying that in the TD limit, the
probability that the generalization error is ǫg is a delta peak centered
at the typical value, of zero variance. At ﬁnite input dimension n, this
probability distribution widens, and its mean value is shifted. Both
these corrections are of order O(1/√n). This behaviour, numerically
veriﬁed within several learning scenarios (Buhot et al., 1997; Nadler and
Fink, 1997; Schroder and Urbanczik, 1998), shows that the predictions
of the statistical mechanics approach are better for larger n.

In our case, Lℓ = {(zi, yi)}i=1,···,ℓ is the set of training patterns in
feature space, with zi = (zui , zσi ) drawn with probability (6), the yi ∈
{−1, +1} being the corresponding classes. The natural cost function E
is:

ℓ

E(w, κ; Lℓ) =

Θ(κ − γi)

(12)

Xi=1
where Θ is the Heaviside function, γi = yizi · w/√w · w is the margin
of pattern zi, and κ is the minimal margin, the smallest allowed distance between the hyperplane and the training patterns. Energy (12)
is thus the number of patterns with margin smaller than κ. The perceptron with weights corresponding to a vanishing cost that maximizes
κ implements the Maximal Margin Hyperplane (MMH).

The properties of the MMH for the most “natural” pattern distribution, an isotropic gaussian, have been thoroughly studied (Opper et
al., 1990; Gordon and Grempel, 1995). The case of a single anisotropy
axis has also been investigated (Marangi et al., 1995). In our model,
the properties of a polynomial SVM are those of a MMH perceptron

with its inputs lying in the feature space, drawn from the anisotropic
gaussian (6), with macroscopic subsets of components having diﬀerent variances. Since the rules to be inferred are assumed to be linear
separations in feature space, we represent them by the weights w∗ =
(wu
∗ ) of a teacher perceptron, so that the class of the patterns is
y = sign(z · w∗). Without any loss of generality we consider normalized
teachers: w∗ · w∗ = ˜n. For the students weights w = (wu, wσ) we take
the same normalization: w · w ≡ wu
Within our model, the values of ∆ and σ depend on the particular
(ﬁnite size) SVM we want to analyze, through equations (7) and (8).
The main diﬀerence with respect to previous work (Dietrich et al., 1999;
Buhot and Gordon, 1999) is that we can make predictions that take into
account the mapping normalization and some ﬁnite-size characteristics
of the SVM.

· wσ = ˜n .

· wu + wσ

We calculate the typical properties of a particular SVM as follows:
we ﬁx ∆ and σ as explained above, and calculate the averages using
distributions (9) and (6), in the limits β → ∞, n → ∞, ℓ → ∞ with
ℓ/n ≡ α constant. A similar procedure has been used in a toy model
(Risau-Gusman and Gordon, 2000) in the context of Gibbs learning.
To obtain the properties of the MMH, we look for the maximal value
of κ with vanishing cost (12). The details of the calculations are left to
the Appendix. In the following we describe the main results.

It turns out that the typical properties of the SVM can be expressed
as a function of the (normalized) squared norm of the teacher weights
in σ-subspace,

and the following averages (also called order parameters, in physics):

the squared norm of the student weights in σ-subspace. Ru is the average of the overlap between the weights of the teacher and the student
in the u-subspace. Rσ is the corresponding overlap in the σ-subspace.

The fraction of training patterns that are Support Vectors, averaged
over all the possible sets of patterns, ρSV , is a bound to the leave-oneout estimator of the generalization error (Vapnik, 1995). Within our

input dimension of the training set (α).

obtained by solving numerically the dual problem (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995), using the Quadratic Optimizer for Pattern Recognition program
(Vanderbei, 1998; Smola, 1999), that we adapted to the case without

1 to 4 as a function of α ≡ ℓ/n, using full and open symbols for
the mappings ΦN and ΦN N respectively. Notice that the abscissas
correspond to the fraction of training patterns per input space dimension. For each value of ℓ, averages were performed over a large enough
number of diﬀerent teachers and training sets to get error bars smaller
than the symbols’ size in the ﬁgures. Experiments were carried out
for n = 50 and n = 20. The corresponding feature space dimensions
n(n + 1) are 2550 and 420 respectively. As both show the same trends,
only results for n = 50 are presented on the ﬁgures. For the sake of
comparison with the theoretical results, we characterize the actual SVM
by ∆, its (ﬁnite size) inﬂation factor (7), and σ2, the variance (8) of
the components in the σ-subspace. Since n = 50, we have ∆ = 25.5
and σ2 = 1.960784a2, that is σ2 = 1.960784 for the non-normalized
mapping and σ2 = 0.039216, for the normalized one.

The theoretical values of Q, the fraction of squared student weights

with the experimental data is striking, and gives an indication that
the high order correlations of the features, neglected in the model, are
indeed negligible. Therefore, we have Rl = Ru, and Rq = Rσ, so that
from now on we can drop the indices l, q and keep u, σ used in the

Figure 1. Order parameters of SVMs for purely linear teacher rules, Q∗ = 0. Symbols
are experimental results for input space dimension n = 50, corresponding to the two
kinds of quadratic mappings, ΦN with a = 1/√n (full symbols) and ΦNN with
normalizing factor a = 1 (open symbols) respectively. Error bars are smaller than
the symbols. The lines are not ﬁts, but the solutions of the Statistical Mechanics
equations for ∆ = (n + 1)/2 and σ2 = na2/∆ with n = 50, and a corresponding to
each mapping.

Fig. 1 corresponds to a purely linear teacher (Q∗ = 0), i.e. to a
quadratic SVM learning a rule linearly separable in input space. As
∗ = 0, only Ru and Q are reprein this case Rσ = 0 because wσ
sented. Conversely, in the case of a purely quadratic rule, Q∗ = 1,
represented on ﬁg. 2, Ru = 0. Notice that Q → Q∗ for α → ∞ in
both cases, meaning that the student learns in which subspace lies
the teacher. Correspondingly, the normalized teacher-student overlap
increases smoothly to 1. However, the pace at which these quantities
reach their asymptotic limit depends on the features normalization
factor, and it is their combination given by eq. (19) that determines
the generalization error ǫg, represented on ﬁg. 5. Clearly, if Q∗ = 0,
i.e. if the problem is linearly separable in input space, the normalized
mapping has lower ǫg at ﬁnite α. Conversely, if the discriminating surface is purely quadratic in input space, the non-normalized mapping
gives better results. In the asymptotic limit α → ∞ the mapping’s
normalization becomes irrelevant, as in both cases the generalization
error vanishes.

are the same as in ﬁgure 1.

Fig. 3 shows the results corresponding to the isotropic teacher, Q∗ =
Q∗; iso ≡ ∆/(1 + ∆). For ∆ = 25.5 we have Q∗; iso = 0.962. A particular
case of such a teacher, considered in (Dietrich et al., 1999; Yoon and Oh,
1998), has all its weight components of equal absolute value |w∗,ν | =
|w∗,νµ| = 1. Finally, the results corresponding to a general rule, with
Q∗ = 0.5, are shown in ﬁg. 4.
Notice that, irrespective of the mapping, the overlaps Ru and Rσ
present diﬀerent behaviours, as the latter increases much slower than
the former. This reﬂects the fact that, as the number of quadratic
components scales like n∆, a number of examples of the order of n∆ are
needed to learn them. Thus, as a function of α, the linear components
are learned ﬁrst. Indeed, Ru reaches a value close to 1 with α ∼ O(1)
while Rσ needs α ∼ O(∆) to reach similar values. We call this general
trend hierarchical learning.
As the generalization error depends on Ru and Rσ through the combination (19), the signature of hierarchical learning is present on the
learning curves ǫg corresponding to the diﬀerent rules, plotted against
α on ﬁg. 5. The performance obtained with the normalized mapping
is better the smaller the value of Q∗. The non-normalized mapping
shows the opposite trend: its performance for a purely linear teacher
(Q∗ = 0) is extremely bad, but it improves for increasing values of Q∗

and slightly overrides that of the normalized mapping in the case of a
purely quadratic teacher.

These results reﬂect the competition on learning the anisotropically
distributed features. The more the features are compressed, the more
diﬃcult the learning task. In the case of rules with Q∗ ≪ 1, the
linear components carry the most signiﬁcant information. In those
cases, it is advantageous to use the normalized mapping, which has
the σ-components compressed (σ2 = 0.039) with respect to the ucomponents, which have unit variance.

The non-normalized mapping has σ2 = 1.96, meaning that the
compressed components are those of the u-subspace. This mapping is
better whenever most of the information is contained in the σ-subspace,
which is the case for teachers with large Q∗ and, in particular, with
Q∗ = 1. In this last case, the linear components only introduce noise
that hinders the learning process. As the number of linear components
is much smaller than the number of quadratic ones, their pernicious
eﬀect is expected to be more conspicuous the smaller the value of ∆.

Finally, for the sake of completeness, the fraction of support vectors
ρSV ≡ ℓSV /ℓ, where ℓSV is the number of training patterns with maximal stability, is represented on ﬁgure 6. Notice that, although these
curves present qualitatively the same trends as ǫg, they constitute a
very loose bound to the latter. Since the student’s weights can be

expressed as a linear combination of SVs (Vapnik, 1995), this result
is of practical interest. It shows that increasing the number of training
patterns does not increase the typical number of non-vanishing coefﬁcients that have to be determined using the quadratic minimization
program: although at low α most of the training patterns are expected
to be support vectors, this fraction decreases smoothly with α. Notice
that α in our approach is the number of training patterns per input
space dimension. Thus, even if ρSV may seem large, this is not so in
regard to the dimension of the feature space. In our simulations for
example, α = 50 is of the order of the VC-dimension of the feature
space. However, from ﬁg. 6 we expect that less than half of the training
patterns be SVs.

5. Discussion

In order to understand the results obtained in the previous section, we
ﬁrst consider the relative behaviour of Ru and Rσ, deduced from the
theoretical approach. If ∆σ
∗ ≪ ∆, which is the case for suﬃciently small

The crossover between these diﬀerent behaviours occurs at ∆σ

for which Rσ = Ru. For n = 50, this arises for Q∗ = 0.998 for the
normalized mapping and for Q∗ = 0.929 for the non-normalized one.
In the particular case of the isotropic teacher and the non-normalized
mapping, Q∗; iso > 0.929, so that Rσ > Ru, as shown on ﬁgure 3.
These considerations alone are not suﬃcient to understand the behaviour of the generalization error, which depends on the weighted sum
of Rσ and Ru (see equation (19)). The behaviour of Rσ and Ru at small
α is useful to understand the onset of hierarchical learning. In the limit
α → 0, we ﬁnd that Q ≃ ∆σ2/(∆σ2 + 1) to leading order in α. This
result may be understood with the following simple argument: if there
is only one training pattern, clearly it is a SV and the student’s weight
vector is proportional to it. As a typical example has n components of
unit length in the u-subspace and n∆ components of length σ in the
σ-subspace, we have Q = n∆σ2/(n∆σ2 + n). With the normalized
mapping, limα→0 Q = 1/2. In the case of the non normalized one
limα→0 Q = (2∆ − 1)/2∆, which depends on the inﬂation factor of
the SVM. In this limit, we obtain:

Therefore, R ∼ √α for α ≪ 1, as for the simple perceptron MMH

In our model, we expect that hierarchical learning correspond to a
fast increase of R at small α, mainly dominated by the contribution of
Ru. As in the limit α → 0,

we do not expect to have hierarchical learning if σ4∆ ≫ 1, as in that
case mainly Rσ contributes to R. This is what happens with the non
normalized mapping. On the other hand, hierarchical learning takes
place if σ4∆ ≪ 1 and ∆σ
∗ . 1. The ﬁrst condition establishes a constraint on the mapping, which is only satisﬁed by the normalized one.
The second condition, that ensures that Rσ < Ru holds, gives the range
of teachers for which this hierarchical generalization takes place. Under

these conditions, R grows fast and the contribution of Rσ is negligible
∗ . The eﬀect of hierarchical learning
because it is weighted by
is more important the smaller ∆σ
∗ . The most dramatic eﬀect arises for
Q∗ = 0, i.e. for a quadratic SVM learning a linearly separable rule.
Notice that if the normalized mapping is used, the condition ∆σ
∗ . 1
implies that Q∗ < Q∗; iso ≡ ∆/(1 + ∆), where Q∗; iso corresponds to
the isotropic teacher. A straightforward calculation shows that if the
teachers are drawn at random on the surface of the hypersphere in
feature space, the distribution of Q∗ is highly non symmetric, with a
maximum at the value of Q∗; iso, that depends on n. The fraction of
teachers with Q∗ < Q∗; iso is smaller than 1/2. For example, only 47.5%
of the teachers satisfy this constraint if n = 50. When n → ∞, the
distribution becomes δ(Q∗ − Q∗; iso), and Q∗; iso tends to the median,
meaning that in this limit, only about 50% of the teachers give rise to
hierarchical learning when using the normalized mapping.

In the limit α → ∞, all the generalization error curves converge to
the same asymptotic value as the simple perceptron MMH learning in
the feature space, namely ǫg = 0.500489(1 + ∆)/α, independently of σ
and Q∗. Thus, ǫg vanishes slower the larger the inﬂation factor ∆.
Since the inﬂation factor ∆ of the SVM feature space in our approach
is a free parameter, it does not diverge in the thermodynamic limit
N → ∞ . As a consequence, the two scaling regimes for ǫg give rise
to a simple crossover between a fast decrease at small α followed by a
slow decrease at large α. The results of Dietrich et al. (Dietrich et al.,

machrev.tex; 22/10/2018; 22:13; p.17

1999) for the normalized mapping, that corresponds to σ2∆ = 1 in our
model, can be deduced by taking appropriately the limits before solving
our saddle point equations. The regime where the number of training
patterns ℓ = αn scales with n, is straightforward. It is obtained, within
our approach, by taking the limit σ → 0 and ∆ → ∞ keeping σ2∆ = 1
and α ﬁnite. The regime where the number of training patterns ℓ =
αn scales with n∆, the number of quadratic features, is obtained by
keeping ˜α ≡ α/(1 + ∆) ﬁnite whilst taking, here again, the limit σ → 0,
∆ → ∞ with σ2∆ = 1. The corresponding curves are represented on
ﬁgure 7 for the case of an isotropic teacher. In order to compare with
our results at ﬁnite ∆, the regime where ˜α is ﬁnite is represented as a
function of α = (1 + ∆)˜α using the value of ∆ corresponding to n = 50,
namely, ∆ = 25.5. In the same ﬁgure we represented the generalization
error ǫg obtained with our model using the parameter values σ2 = 0.039
and ∆ = 25.5.

These results, obtained for quadratic SVMs, are easily generalizable
to higher order polynomial SVMs, as is the case with the approach of
(Dietrich et al., 1999). We expect a cascade of hierarchical decreasings
of the generalization error as a function of α, in which successively more
and more compressed features are learned.

6. Conclusion

We introduced a model that clariﬁes some aspects of the generalization properties of polynomial Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in
high dimensional feature spaces. To this end, we focused on quadratic
SVMs. The quadratic features, which are the pairwise products of input
components, may be scaled by a normalizing factor. Depending on its
value, the generalization error presents very diﬀerent behaviours in the
thermodynamic limit (Dietrich et al., 1999; Buhot and Gordon, 1999).
We showed that any ﬁnite size quadratic SVM may be characterized
by two parameters: ∆ and σ. The inﬂation factor ∆ is the number
of quadratic features relative to the number of input features, and is
proportional to the input space dimension n. The variance σ of the
quadratic features is related to the normalizing factor. Usually, either
σ ∼ 1/√n (normalized mapping) or σ ∼ 1 (non normalized mapping).
In previous studies, not only the input space dimension diverges in the
thermodynamic limit n → ∞, but also ∆ and σ are correspondingly
scaled.
In our model, the proportion of quadratic features ∆ and their
variance σ are considered as parameters characterizing the (ﬁnite size)
SVMs. Since we keep them constant when taking the thermodynamic

19

limit, we can study the learning properties of actual SVMs with ﬁnite
inﬂation ratios and normalizing factors, as a function of α ≡ ℓ/n, where
ℓ is the number of training examples.
Our theoretical results were obtained neglecting the correlations
among the quadratic features. Indeed, their eﬀect does not seem to
be important, as the agreement between our computer experiments
with actual SVMs and the theoretical predictions is excellent. This
approximation was also shown to give good predictions in other similar problems (Dietrich et al., 1999; Yoon and Oh, 1998), but further
investigations are needed to establish rigorously the conditions of its
validity.

We ﬁnd that the generalization error ǫg depends on the type of rule
to be inferred through Q∗, the (normalized) teacher’s squared weight
components in the quadratic subspace. If the normalized mapping is
used and Q∗ is small enough, the behaviour of ǫg at small α is dominated by the high rate learning of the linear components. On increasing
α, there is a crossover to a regime where the decrease of ǫg becomes
much slower. This crossover becomes smoother for increasing values of
Q∗, and this eﬀect of hierarchical learning disappears for large enough
Q∗. If the limits ∆ ∼ n → ∞ and σ2
∼ 1/n → 0 are taken together
with the thermodynamic limit, the hierarchical learning eﬀect gives
rise to the diﬀerent scaling regimes, corresponding to ℓ ∼ n or ℓ ∼ n2,
described previously (Yoon and Oh, 1998; Dietrich et al., 1999).
On the other hand, if the features are not normalized, the contributions of both the linear and the quadratic components to ǫg are of the
same order, and there is no hierarchical learning at all. For Q∗ > Q∗; iso,
which corresponds to the isotropic teacher, the non normalized mapping
has a slightly smaller generalization error than the normalized one.

It is worth remarking that if the rule to be learned allows for hierarchical learning, the generalization error of the normalized mapping is
much smaller than that of the non normalized one. In fact, the teachers
corresponding to such rules are those with Q∗ . Q∗;iso, where Q∗; iso
corresponds to the isotropic teacher, the one having all its weights
components equal. For the others, both the normalized mapping and
the non normalized one present similar performances. If the weights of
the teacher are selected at random on a hypersphere in feature space,
the most probable teachers have precisely Q∗ = Q∗; iso, and the fraction
of teachers with Q∗ ≤ Q∗; iso represent of the order of 50% of the
inferable rules. Thus, from a practical point of view, without having
any prior knowledge about the rule underlying a set of examples, the
normalized mapping should be preferred.

As the tasks considered are learnable, the solution that minimizes
the cost function (12) with maximal κ is unique. Thus, in the following
we may assume that replica symmetry holds. Then, qabu = qu, qabσ =
qσ for all a, b, and the saddle point equations corresponding to the
extremum of the free energy for the MMH are:
