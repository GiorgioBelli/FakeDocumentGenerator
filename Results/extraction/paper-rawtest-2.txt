====================ABSTRACT====================
Abstract. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an exciting and promising
paradigm inside quantum technologies.
It may permit, on the one hand, to carry
out more eﬃcient machine learning calculations by means of quantum devices, while,
on the other hand, to employ machine learning techniques to better control quantum
systems. Inside quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning aims at
developing “intelligent” quantum agents that may interact with the outer world and
adapt to it, with the strategy of achieving some ﬁnal goal. Another paradigm inside
quantum machine learning is that of quantum autoencoders, which may allow one
for employing fewer resources in a quantum device via a training process. Moreover,
the ﬁeld of quantum biomimetics aims at establishing analogies between biological
and quantum systems, to look for previously inadvertent connections that may enable
useful applications. Two recent examples are the concepts of quantum artiﬁcial life,
as well as of quantum memristors. In this Perspective, we give an overview of these
topics, describing the related research carried out by the scientiﬁc community.

====================INTRODUCTION====================
1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of quantum technologies has experienced a signiﬁcant boost in the past ﬁve
years. The interest of multinational companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Intel,
and Alibaba in this area has increased the worldwide competition and available funding
not only from these ﬁrms, but also from national and supranational governments,
such as the European Union [1, 2]. Most of these companies have also a strong
focus on machine learning, which is a wider-deployed technology, as it is currently
more advanced. Increases in the past decade in computing power, via, e.g., Graphical
Processing Units (GPUs), and the extensive availability of data in internet, have enabled
a signiﬁcantly good performance of deep learning. Among others, image recognition,

language translation, search engines, automated cars, and personal assistants, have
become widespread nowadays [3, 4].

Given that quantum systems are well described by linear algebra, and this also
applies to several machine learning algorithms,
it was only a matter of time that
these two ﬁelds merged in a new area, namely, quantum machine learning. An
exponentially-growing amount of papers has appeared in this area in the past three
to four years [5], and already several books and reviews on this ﬁeld have been
published [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Existing algorithms include quantum solvers of
linear systems of equations [13], quantum support vector machines [14], quantum
principal component analysis [15], quantum gradient estimation [16], and distributed
secure quantum machine learning [17], among others. Further research areas inside
quantum machine learning include quantum reinforcement learning [18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25], quantum autoencoders [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], quantum neural
networks [11, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], as well as quantum annealing [38, 39, 40],
quantum Boltzmann [41, 42, 43] and quantum Helmholtz machines [44, 45]. Another
research avenue complementary to the former ones, consists in employing machine
learning algorithms to better control quantum systems, reduce gate errors, increase
state preparation ﬁdelities, and compute quantum phases of matter [46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52, 53]. Moreover, inside this emerging area, a growing amount of papers in the ﬁeld
of machine learning for better understanding quantum systems can be also classiﬁed
in reinforcement learning [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], supervised
learning [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75], and unsupervised learning [76, 77] works. For
a recent review on this speciﬁc ﬁeld, see [78]. Finally, another interesting topic that has
appeared recently is the one of quantum-inspired algorithms, namely, classical machine
learning algorithms that get inspiration from quantum algorithms [79, 80].

Another ﬁeld that aims at connecting two previously disconnected research areas
such as quantum technologies and biological systems [81, 82, 83] is the one of quantum
biomimetics. This has some overlap with quantum machine learning in topics such
as, e.g., quantum neural networks, which are also biomimetic: They consist of a
quantization of neural networks that, in turn, get inspiration from the human brain,
a biological system. Quantum artiﬁcial life is an area inside quantum biomimetics in
which the aim is to design quantum individuals that can self-replicate in a quantum
fashion, namely, without breaking the no-cloning theorem [84, 85, 86, 87]. They can
also mutate, and evolve with a quantum Darwinian process. Even though this is still
a ﬁeld in its infancy, we expect that it could have connections with quantum game
theory [88] and could allow one for encoding optimization problems, being this way
connected again with the quantum machine learning ﬁeld. Related research has been
carried out by diverse groups [89, 90, 91, 92]. A second area inside quantum biomimetics
is the one of quantum memristors [93, 94, 95, 96]. These are devices with processing
power, memory, and quantum character, inspired in the classical memristor, the fourth
element in electronic engineering in addition to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor [97].
A classical memristor has processing capacity at the same time as memory, and has been

conjectured to be able to solve NP problems in polynomial time. Classical memristors
may provide a novel paradigm for computing, with a neuromorphic architecture, and,
equivalently, quantum memristors represent the basic building block for a neuromorphic
quantum computer. They have also a close connection to quantum neural networks, and
may provide a platform to quantum simulate non-Markovian quantum open systems.

In this Perspective, we will revise the ﬁelds of quantum machine learning and
quantum biomimetics, without the goal of being exhaustive, and focusing mainly on
our own research of the past six years, as well as related research by other groups. Our
motivation is to give our vision of what has been the development of these two ﬁelds in
the past few years, and what could be their future evolution. Even though these two
areas may seem rather disconnected at ﬁrst sight, they have a strong relationship, as
described for example in Ref. [82] for the classical cases: living systems, either natural
or artiﬁcial, have often the ability to learn. Being this article also a Perspective, it is
naturally more biased towards my own research, and that of my collaborators at the
QUTIS Group in University of the Basque Country [98], which has considered these
two ﬁelds in parallel and with multiple links. As examples of this, one can mention the
international conference we coorganized in Bilbao in March 2018, on “Quantum Machine
Learning & Biomimetic Quantum Technologies”, as well as the Special Issue we edited
on “Quantum Machine Learning and Bioinspired Quantum Technologies” [99]. We will
ﬁrst start with Section 2, on quantum machine learning, in which we will describe two
emerging topics inside this area, namely, quantum reinforcement learning, and quantum
autoencoders. In Section 3, on quantum biomimetics, we will revise other two topics, i.e.,
quantum artiﬁcial life, both as a proposal and its experimental realization in the IBM
cloud quantum computer, and quantum memristors. We will then give our conclusions
in Section 4.

2. Quantum machine learning

Machine learning is one of the ﬁelds with a larger impact in computer science
nowadays [4].
Its inﬂuence is widespread along a large number of technologies and
economies, and this will only grow in the future. One of the reasons for this success
is the so-called deep learning technology [3]. This kind of approach, based on neural
networks with several layers, and the backpropagation algorithm, has existed since the
80’s, but only recently has started to work eﬃciently. This is due to the availability of
higher processing capabilities, via GPUs, and the large amount of data at disposal, i.e.,
Big Data from the internet [3]. The typical machine learning algorithms are divided
into three classes. A ﬁrst class of machine learning algorithms is named supervised
learning [4]. These algorithms are trained via feeding them with labeled data, e.g.,
training a neural network with pictures of cats. After several iterations of the learning
process, the network is able, if properly trained, to diﬀerentiate a picture from a cat from
one of, say, a dog. A second class of machine learning algorithms is named unsupervised
learning [4]. In this case, no labeled data is provided, while, in turn, the learning is

produced via establishing correlations in the available data itself that one wants to
classify. Via grouping this data in clusters, one is able to allocate new data inside
one of these clusters, according to the highest proximity to it following some ﬁgure of
merit, e.g., mathematical distance. Finally, a third class of machine learning algorithms,
that is possibly more similar to the way the human brain itself learns, is the one of
reinforcement learning [4, 100]. In this kind of learning, a system, the agent, which can
be, for instance, a robot, a computer program, a chemical molecule, or a quantum device,
interacts with another system, the environment, which is the outer world to it, that is
also relevant to its dynamics [4, 100]. In this interaction, the agent obtains information
from the environment, and also carries out some action on it, possibly modifying it. It
then decides on a strategy, or policy, on how to proceed, depending on the feedback
obtained from the interaction and action, and, iterating this procedure several times,
aims at achieving some ﬁnal goal. Reinforcement learning is the kind of learning that has
taken more time to develop inside machine learning, but it has proven one of the most
successful ones in the past few years, with the impressive achievements of AlphaGo and
AlphaGo Zero in beating the Grandmasters of Go [101, 102]. Go is a highly strategic
game, much more complex than chess, which was not expected to be won by an artiﬁcial
intelligence anytime soon. However, via a combination of supervised and reinforcement
learning, AlphaGo beat some of the leading human experts at Go [101]. Later on,
AlphaGo Zero beat AlphaGo by 100-0, employing only reinforcement learning, playing
millions of times against itself and learning in each iteration a bit more, an impressive
achievement without any external training [102].

A diﬀerent kind of approach is the concept of autoencoder [3]. It consists of a neural
network that allows for compressing information, in the following fashion: the network
contains an input layer (encoder), with a number of neurons, say, n. Then, it has one
or more inner layers, with a number of neurons n(cid:48) < n. And ﬁnally, it is connected to
an output layer (decoder) with again n neurons. One then trains this kind of network
with data, assuming that it can be compressed (namely, it has common features). The
process consists on aiming at matching the output signal of the network with the input
signal, i.e., being able to employ only the n(cid:48) neurons to encode the information, instead
of the n initial ones, which is a larger number. If the process is successful, one may then
discard the decoder and keep only the input layer, the encoder, therefore compressing
the information.

In this Section, we will focus ﬁrstly on the machine learning algorithm known as
reinforcement learning, and its recent development in the quantum realm, i.e., quantum
reinforcement learning. We will describe the pioneering work by diﬀerent groups in this
topic, as well as our own results of the past few years.

Later on, we will analyze the quantum version of autoencoders, namely, quantum
autoencoders, and describe the eﬀorts by several groups both in theory and experiments
in developing this technology.

2.1. Quantum reinforcement learning

Figure 1. Scheme of reinforcement learning. A system, called agent, interacts with
the external world, the environment, realizing some action on it, as well as obtaining
information from it, via a percept. Subsequently, the agent decides on a strategy on
how to act or improve itself, by means of a reward criterion that depends on the action
and percept, and the process is iterated. The motivation for the agent to follow this
procedure is achieving a ﬁnal goal. In the quantum reinforcement learning scenario,
either agent, environment, or both, should be quantum, and they may exchange either
quantum or classical information, or a mixture of both, with possible feedback in each
iteration. Adapted from Ref. [21].

In the ﬁeld of quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning (see
Fig. 1) is a paradigm that has emerged in recent years [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 54, 55]. Some of the published works consider a quantum agent and a quantum
environment (so called QQ scenario) [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], others consider a quantum
agent and classical environment (QC) [18, 19, 20], another possibility would be to analyze
a classical agent and quantum environment (CQ), while the fourth available combination
(CC) corresponds to the purely classical situation of standard reinforcement learning.

In Ref.

[18], a mapping of classical reinforcement learning onto quantum
reinforcement learning, connecting states of the former with quantum states of the
is proposed. Quantum superposition and entanglement are involved in the
latter,
quantum algorithm, giving evidence of a possible resource gain with respect to classical
reinforcement learning. The proposed protocol
is based on Grover algorithm for
unstructured search with quantum computers [103].

Ref. [19] analyzes a possible quantum advantage of a quantum agent interacting
with a classical environment with classical channels, where the speedup would come

from a faster quantum processor in the agent. This would be based, as in the previous
case, in Grover search.

Ref. [20] explores quantum reinforcement learning among other types of quantum
learning, showing that quadratic improvements in learning eﬃciency, as well as
exponential
improvements in performance over limited amounts of time, may be
achieved. For this, they consider a quantum agent and a quantum oracular environment.
The series of references [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] deal with quantum reinforcement learning
in the QQ scenario, namely, quantum agent and quantum environment, in an increasing
amount of complexity, and focusing on possible implementations. Refs. [21, 22] propose
basic protocols of quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits,
including either coherent feedback inside the protocol, or projective measurements. In
both cases, a single copy of the quantum environment state is considered, and the goal
of the agent is to achieve a ﬁnal quantum state that is identical to the environment
one while, necessarily, modifying the latter. Ref. [23] goes a step forward, taking
into account several copies of the quantum environment state, such that the agent
can achieve an increasing overlap with this state, which is its ﬁnal goal. In Ref. [24], an
experimental implementation of the previous proposal in quantum photonics was carried
out. Interestingly, a gain of this quantum reinforcement learning protocol with respect
to standard quantum tomography was achieved, in the limited resources scenario. In
the subsequent Ref. [25], an extension of the protocol to unknown operations, instead of
states, was analyzed. Namely, this proposal would allow one to determine an unknown
quantum operation, or, equivalently, its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, via a quantum
reinforcement learning protocol.

2.2. Quantum autoencoders

Recently, proposals and experiments for quantum autoencoders have been explored by
diﬀerent groups (see Fig. 2).
In Refs. [26, 27], one is given a set of states, inside a
certain Hilbert space, and the aim is to be able to consider a smaller section of the
Hilbert space that contains all the relevant information, namely, to somehow compress
the quantum information onto a smaller amount of quantum bits or qubits. To this
aim, in analogy with classical autoencoders, a quantum circuit composed of an input
series of qubits is connected, via a parameterized unitary operation, to a smaller amount
of qubits, and, subsequently, by means of a second parameterized unitary gate, to the
same amount of qubits as the input. By feeding this quantum circuit with the set of
states considered initially, and by measuring the output of the circuit, one may train
the device, via classical feedback onto the parameters of the two unitary gates, in order
to maximize the output ﬁdelity with respect to the input states. This is similar to the
standard autoencoder but in a quantum scenario.
If the training is successful, then
one may discard the ﬁnal unitary gate, equivalent to the decoder, and keep only the
initial one, the encoder, therefore reducing the amount of quantum information needed
for practical applications. This could be useful, e.g., for quantum simulations [26]. An

experimental realization of the previous proposal [26] has been carried out in a quantum
photonics platform employing a three-level quantum system, a qutrit [29].

Figure 2. Scheme of a quantum autoencoder, based on the algorithms in Refs. [26, 27].
A set of input quantum states in a certain Hilbert space is encoded into a smaller
Hilbert space via a learning process. Adapted from Ref. [28].

A diﬀerent approach to quantum autoencoders was put forward in Refs. [28, 30] (see
Fig. 3). This is based on encoding the initial quantum information in a more reduced
amount of qubits via the use of approximate quantum adders. In Ref. [104], a theorem
was proven that showed that a unitary operation able to add two unknown quantum
states is forbidden by the laws of quantum physics (see also Ref. [105]). Nevertheless,
this paper deﬁned approximate quantum adders optimized according to diverse prespeciﬁed criteria. In Ref. [49], an optimization of approximate quantum adders based
on genetic algorithms, a kind of machine learning algorithm, was realized. Subsequently,
Ref. [28] developed a proposal for a quantum autoencoder based on the quantum adders
optimized in Ref. [49]. Finally, Ref. [30] implemented the previous proposal in the
Rigetti cloud quantum computer, showing its feasibility.

Finally, another kind of autoencoders in the quantum realm has been proposed and
implemented in the same article [31], namely, variational quantum autoencoders, which
describe generative models implemented via quantum Boltzmann machines [41].

3. Quantum biomimetics

Quantum biomimetics is the ﬁeld that aims at connecting other two previously
disconnected research areas such as quantum technologies and biological systems [81, 83].
This has links to quantum machine learning in areas such as, e.g., quantum neural
networks, which are also biomimetic systems. Quantum artiﬁcial life is a ﬁeld inside
quantum biomimetics in which the objective is to design quantum individuals that can
self-replicate in a quantum way, namely, in a compatible manner with the no-cloning
theorem [84, 85, 86, 87]. A second ﬁeld in quantum biomimetics is the one called
quantum memristors [93, 94, 95, 96]. These are inspired in the classical memristor,

ﬁdelity, via an approximate quantum adder operation. Adapted from Ref. [28].

the fourth element in electronic engineering in addition to the resistor, capacitor, and
inductor [97]. A classical memristor can process information at the same time as having
a memory, and may provide a novel paradigm for computing, with a neuromorphic
architecture. Equivalently, quantum memristors constitute a basic building block for a
neuromorphic quantum processor.

In this Section, we will ﬁrst revise the topic of quantum artiﬁcial life, beginning
with theoretical works [84, 85] and ﬁnishing with an experimental implementation in
the IBM cloud quantum computer [86].

Later on, we will describe the topic of quantum memristors, according to a series

of results in the literature [93, 94, 95, 96].

3.1. Quantum artiﬁcial life

Artiﬁcial life is a research ﬁeld that aims to reproduce biological properties common
to living systems in artiﬁcially engineered systems [81, 82]. Some examples are selfassembling robots [106], self-replicating chemicals [107] or computing programs [108],
as well as living neurons grown in the lab and connected to external devices [109].
One of the main areas inside this thriving ﬁeld is the self-replicating systems. Living
systems acquire complexity and structure via Darwinian evolution, or natural selection,
and this is a combination of self-replication, introduction of variability via mutations
as well as genome exchange, and selection of the ﬁttest. Therefore, self-replication is
In the research line of quantum artiﬁcial life, a series
one of the hallmarks of life.
of works has explored the possibility for elementary quantum systems to undergo selfreplication [84, 85, 86] . This is a non-trivial issue given that the no-cloning theorem [87]
prevents the perfect copying of unknown quantum states. Thus, perfect self-replication
onto distinct progeny individuals would not be allowed. What these works show is that
the full quantum information can be faithfully transferred to the progeny individuals,

under ideal conditions, if one maps the classical information of the diagonal elements of
the parent density matrix onto the diﬀerent progeny systems. On the other hand, the
coherences of the parent density matrix would be mapped onto quantum correlations
of the progeny systems. Therefore, entanglement plays a crucial role in the context of
having self-replicating quantum systems.

Figure 4. Scheme for quantum artiﬁcial life. A quantum living unit, or quantum
individual, is created from two qubits, which constitute the genotype and phenotype.
The phenotype then decoheres when coupled with a quantum reservoir, until producing
the “death” of the quantum individual. While still “alive”, the quantum individual can
undergo self-replication, via coupling with further ancillary qubits. In order to transfer
its full quantum information, the original quantum individual becomes entangled with
its progeny quantum individuals. Adapted from Ref. [85].

In Ref. [84], a ﬁrst analysis of biomimetic cloning of quantum observables was
carried out, suggesting that the full quantum information may be transferred onto
successive generations via cloning of classical
information together with controlled
transfer of quantum correlations. Later on, Ref. [85] proposed an implementation of
a model of quantum artiﬁcial life. In this model, a quantum living unit, or quantum
individual, is composed of two qubits, one for the genetic information, or genotype,
and another for the expression of the genotype in the environment, or phenotype.
The individual is created via a partial cloning operation of the genotype onto the
phenotype via a Controlled-NOT operation, a kind of entangling two-qubit quantum
gate. Subsequently, the phenotype can get coupled with a quantum reservoir, that
induces decoherence on it. After a certain amount of time, the phenotype has almost
totally decohered, and one considers that it has “died”, at least as an artiﬁcial life
individual, and according to this model. While the quantum individual is still “alive”,

10

it can couple with further ancillary qubits, carrying out additional partial cloning
operations with Controlled-NOT gates, and produce new quantum individuals, which
become entangled to the initial one, as previously explained (see Fig. 4).

experimentally carried out in Ref. [86]. The number of two-qubit Controlled-NOT
entangling gates is of 20. H denotes a Hadamard gate, and the numbers inside the
single-qubit gates indicate diﬀerent phases, as described in Ref. [86].

In Ref. [86], a quantum implementation of the quantum artiﬁcial life model of
Ref. [85] was carried out in the IBM cloud quantum computer. Fig. 5 shows the most
complex quantum circuit that was implemented in this experiment. The number of
entangling gates was of 20. On the other hand, Fig. 6 depicts the theoretical (yellow)

ﬁdelities are not perfect, the experimental setup qualitatively reproduces the theoretical
prediction to a large extent, for an experiment of a certain complexity.

3.2. Quantum memristors

two proposals for implementations of quantum memristors in
diﬀerent quantum platforms were put forward, namely, superconducting circuits [94]
and quantum photonics [95].
In the former, the memristive behavior emerges from
quasiparticle-induced tunneling when supercurrent cancellation takes place. For realistic
parameters, the appearing hysteretic behavior may be measured using state-of-theart tomography of the phase-driven tunneling current.
In the latter, the memristive
behaviour arises from a tunable beam splitter, to which the input state is directed,
together with feedback from one of the output ports onto the beam splitter that modiﬁes
its reﬂectivity depending on the output signal.

Finally, another result has been published on some complementary devices to

quantum memristors, namely, qubit-based memcapacitors and meminductors [96].

counterparts is still an open problem. Nevertheless, they represent a novel and promising
quantum system that may play an important role in the future in a wide variety of
scenarios as distributed quantum computing, quantum neural networks, and simulation
of non-Markovian quantum systems.

Abstract. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an exciting and promising
paradigm inside quantum technologies.
It may permit, on the one hand, to carry
out more eﬃcient machine learning calculations by means of quantum devices, while,
on the other hand, to employ machine learning techniques to better control quantum
systems. Inside quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning aims at
developing “intelligent” quantum agents that may interact with the outer world and
adapt to it, with the strategy of achieving some ﬁnal goal. Another paradigm inside
quantum machine learning is that of quantum autoencoders, which may allow one
for employing fewer resources in a quantum device via a training process. Moreover,
the ﬁeld of quantum biomimetics aims at establishing analogies between biological
and quantum systems, to look for previously inadvertent connections that may enable
useful applications. Two recent examples are the concepts of quantum artiﬁcial life,
as well as of quantum memristors. In this Perspective, we give an overview of these
topics, describing the related research carried out by the scientiﬁc community.

1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of quantum technologies has experienced a signiﬁcant boost in the past ﬁve
years. The interest of multinational companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Intel,
and Alibaba in this area has increased the worldwide competition and available funding
not only from these ﬁrms, but also from national and supranational governments,
such as the European Union [1, 2]. Most of these companies have also a strong
focus on machine learning, which is a wider-deployed technology, as it is currently

a signiﬁcantly good performance of deep learning. Among others, image recognition,

language translation, search engines, automated cars, and personal assistants, have
become widespread nowadays [3, 4].

Given that quantum systems are well described by linear algebra, and this also
applies to several machine learning algorithms,
it was only a matter of time that
these two ﬁelds merged in a new area, namely, quantum machine learning. An
exponentially-growing amount of papers has appeared in this area in the past three
to four years [5], and already several books and reviews on this ﬁeld have been
published [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Existing algorithms include quantum solvers of
linear systems of equations [13], quantum support vector machines [14], quantum
principal component analysis [15], quantum gradient estimation [16], and distributed
secure quantum machine learning [17], among others. Further research areas inside
quantum machine learning include quantum reinforcement learning [18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25], quantum autoencoders [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], quantum neural
networks [11, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], as well as quantum annealing [38, 39, 40],
quantum Boltzmann [41, 42, 43] and quantum Helmholtz machines [44, 45]. Another
research avenue complementary to the former ones, consists in employing machine
learning algorithms to better control quantum systems, reduce gate errors, increase
state preparation ﬁdelities, and compute quantum phases of matter [46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52, 53]. Moreover, inside this emerging area, a growing amount of papers in the ﬁeld
of machine learning for better understanding quantum systems can be also classiﬁed
in reinforcement learning [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], supervised
learning [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75], and unsupervised learning [76, 77] works. For
a recent review on this speciﬁc ﬁeld, see [78]. Finally, another interesting topic that has
appeared recently is the one of quantum-inspired algorithms, namely, classical machine
learning algorithms that get inspiration from quantum algorithms [79, 80].

Another ﬁeld that aims at connecting two previously disconnected research areas
such as quantum technologies and biological systems [81, 82, 83] is the one of quantum
biomimetics. This has some overlap with quantum machine learning in topics such
as, e.g., quantum neural networks, which are also biomimetic: They consist of a
quantization of neural networks that, in turn, get inspiration from the human brain,
a biological system. Quantum artiﬁcial life is an area inside quantum biomimetics in
which the aim is to design quantum individuals that can self-replicate in a quantum
fashion, namely, without breaking the no-cloning theorem [84, 85, 86, 87]. They can
also mutate, and evolve with a quantum Darwinian process. Even though this is still
a ﬁeld in its infancy, we expect that it could have connections with quantum game
theory [88] and could allow one for encoding optimization problems, being this way
connected again with the quantum machine learning ﬁeld. Related research has been
carried out by diverse groups [89, 90, 91, 92]. A second area inside quantum biomimetics
is the one of quantum memristors [93, 94, 95, 96]. These are devices with processing
power, memory, and quantum character, inspired in the classical memristor, the fourth
element in electronic engineering in addition to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor [97].
A classical memristor has processing capacity at the same time as memory, and has been

conjectured to be able to solve NP problems in polynomial time. Classical memristors
may provide a novel paradigm for computing, with a neuromorphic architecture, and,
equivalently, quantum memristors represent the basic building block for a neuromorphic
quantum computer. They have also a close connection to quantum neural networks, and
may provide a platform to quantum simulate non-Markovian quantum open systems.

In this Perspective, we will revise the ﬁelds of quantum machine learning and
quantum biomimetics, without the goal of being exhaustive, and focusing mainly on
our own research of the past six years, as well as related research by other groups. Our
motivation is to give our vision of what has been the development of these two ﬁelds in
the past few years, and what could be their future evolution. Even though these two
areas may seem rather disconnected at ﬁrst sight, they have a strong relationship, as
described for example in Ref. [82] for the classical cases: living systems, either natural
or artiﬁcial, have often the ability to learn. Being this article also a Perspective, it is
naturally more biased towards my own research, and that of my collaborators at the
QUTIS Group in University of the Basque Country [98], which has considered these
two ﬁelds in parallel and with multiple links. As examples of this, one can mention the
international conference we coorganized in Bilbao in March 2018, on “Quantum Machine
Learning & Biomimetic Quantum Technologies”, as well as the Special Issue we edited
on “Quantum Machine Learning and Bioinspired Quantum Technologies” [99]. We will
ﬁrst start with Section 2, on quantum machine learning, in which we will describe two
emerging topics inside this area, namely, quantum reinforcement learning, and quantum
autoencoders. In Section 3, on quantum biomimetics, we will revise other two topics, i.e.,
quantum artiﬁcial life, both as a proposal and its experimental realization in the IBM
cloud quantum computer, and quantum memristors. We will then give our conclusions
in Section 4.

2. Quantum machine learning

Machine learning is one of the ﬁelds with a larger impact in computer science
nowadays [4].
Its inﬂuence is widespread along a large number of technologies and
economies, and this will only grow in the future. One of the reasons for this success
is the so-called deep learning technology [3]. This kind of approach, based on neural
networks with several layers, and the backpropagation algorithm, has existed since the
80’s, but only recently has started to work eﬃciently. This is due to the availability of
higher processing capabilities, via GPUs, and the large amount of data at disposal, i.e.,
Big Data from the internet [3]. The typical machine learning algorithms are divided
into three classes. A ﬁrst class of machine learning algorithms is named supervised
learning [4]. These algorithms are trained via feeding them with labeled data, e.g.,
training a neural network with pictures of cats. After several iterations of the learning
process, the network is able, if properly trained, to diﬀerentiate a picture from a cat from
one of, say, a dog. A second class of machine learning algorithms is named unsupervised
learning [4]. In this case, no labeled data is provided, while, in turn, the learning is

produced via establishing correlations in the available data itself that one wants to
classify. Via grouping this data in clusters, one is able to allocate new data inside
one of these clusters, according to the highest proximity to it following some ﬁgure of
merit, e.g., mathematical distance. Finally, a third class of machine learning algorithms,
that is possibly more similar to the way the human brain itself learns, is the one of
reinforcement learning [4, 100]. In this kind of learning, a system, the agent, which can
be, for instance, a robot, a computer program, a chemical molecule, or a quantum device,
interacts with another system, the environment, which is the outer world to it, that is
also relevant to its dynamics [4, 100]. In this interaction, the agent obtains information
from the environment, and also carries out some action on it, possibly modifying it. It
then decides on a strategy, or policy, on how to proceed, depending on the feedback
obtained from the interaction and action, and, iterating this procedure several times,
aims at achieving some ﬁnal goal. Reinforcement learning is the kind of learning that has
taken more time to develop inside machine learning, but it has proven one of the most
successful ones in the past few years, with the impressive achievements of AlphaGo and
AlphaGo Zero in beating the Grandmasters of Go [101, 102]. Go is a highly strategic
game, much more complex than chess, which was not expected to be won by an artiﬁcial
intelligence anytime soon. However, via a combination of supervised and reinforcement
learning, AlphaGo beat some of the leading human experts at Go [101]. Later on,
AlphaGo Zero beat AlphaGo by 100-0, employing only reinforcement learning, playing
millions of times against itself and learning in each iteration a bit more, an impressive
achievement without any external training [102].

A diﬀerent kind of approach is the concept of autoencoder [3]. It consists of a neural
network that allows for compressing information, in the following fashion: the network
contains an input layer (encoder), with a number of neurons, say, n. Then, it has one
or more inner layers, with a number of neurons n(cid:48) < n. And ﬁnally, it is connected to
an output layer (decoder) with again n neurons. One then trains this kind of network
with data, assuming that it can be compressed (namely, it has common features). The
process consists on aiming at matching the output signal of the network with the input
signal, i.e., being able to employ only the n(cid:48) neurons to encode the information, instead
of the n initial ones, which is a larger number. If the process is successful, one may then
discard the decoder and keep only the input layer, the encoder, therefore compressing
the information.

In this Section, we will focus ﬁrstly on the machine learning algorithm known as
reinforcement learning, and its recent development in the quantum realm, i.e., quantum
reinforcement learning. We will describe the pioneering work by diﬀerent groups in this
topic, as well as our own results of the past few years.

Later on, we will analyze the quantum version of autoencoders, namely, quantum
autoencoders, and describe the eﬀorts by several groups both in theory and experiments
in developing this technology.

2.1. Quantum reinforcement learning

Figure 1. Scheme of reinforcement learning. A system, called agent, interacts with
the external world, the environment, realizing some action on it, as well as obtaining
information from it, via a percept. Subsequently, the agent decides on a strategy on
how to act or improve itself, by means of a reward criterion that depends on the action
and percept, and the process is iterated. The motivation for the agent to follow this
procedure is achieving a ﬁnal goal. In the quantum reinforcement learning scenario,
either agent, environment, or both, should be quantum, and they may exchange either
quantum or classical information, or a mixture of both, with possible feedback in each
iteration. Adapted from Ref. [21].

In the ﬁeld of quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning (see
Fig. 1) is a paradigm that has emerged in recent years [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 54, 55]. Some of the published works consider a quantum agent and a quantum
environment (so called QQ scenario) [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], others consider a quantum
agent and classical environment (QC) [18, 19, 20], another possibility would be to analyze
a classical agent and quantum environment (CQ), while the fourth available combination
(CC) corresponds to the purely classical situation of standard reinforcement learning.

In Ref.

[18], a mapping of classical reinforcement learning onto quantum
reinforcement learning, connecting states of the former with quantum states of the
is proposed. Quantum superposition and entanglement are involved in the
latter,
quantum algorithm, giving evidence of a possible resource gain with respect to classical
reinforcement learning. The proposed protocol
is based on Grover algorithm for
unstructured search with quantum computers [103].

Ref. [19] analyzes a possible quantum advantage of a quantum agent interacting
with a classical environment with classical channels, where the speedup would come

from a faster quantum processor in the agent. This would be based, as in the previous
case, in Grover search.

Ref. [20] explores quantum reinforcement learning among other types of quantum
learning, showing that quadratic improvements in learning eﬃciency, as well as
exponential
improvements in performance over limited amounts of time, may be
achieved. For this, they consider a quantum agent and a quantum oracular environment.
The series of references [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] deal with quantum reinforcement learning
in the QQ scenario, namely, quantum agent and quantum environment, in an increasing
amount of complexity, and focusing on possible implementations. Refs. [21, 22] propose
basic protocols of quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits,
including either coherent feedback inside the protocol, or projective measurements. In
both cases, a single copy of the quantum environment state is considered, and the goal
of the agent is to achieve a ﬁnal quantum state that is identical to the environment
one while, necessarily, modifying the latter. Ref. [23] goes a step forward, taking
into account several copies of the quantum environment state, such that the agent
can achieve an increasing overlap with this state, which is its ﬁnal goal. In Ref. [24], an
experimental implementation of the previous proposal in quantum photonics was carried
out. Interestingly, a gain of this quantum reinforcement learning protocol with respect
to standard quantum tomography was achieved, in the limited resources scenario. In
the subsequent Ref. [25], an extension of the protocol to unknown operations, instead of
states, was analyzed. Namely, this proposal would allow one to determine an unknown
quantum operation, or, equivalently, its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, via a quantum
reinforcement learning protocol.

2.2. Quantum autoencoders

Recently, proposals and experiments for quantum autoencoders have been explored by
diﬀerent groups (see Fig. 2).
In Refs. [26, 27], one is given a set of states, inside a
certain Hilbert space, and the aim is to be able to consider a smaller section of the
Hilbert space that contains all the relevant information, namely, to somehow compress
the quantum information onto a smaller amount of quantum bits or qubits. To this
aim, in analogy with classical autoencoders, a quantum circuit composed of an input
series of qubits is connected, via a parameterized unitary operation, to a smaller amount
of qubits, and, subsequently, by means of a second parameterized unitary gate, to the
same amount of qubits as the input. By feeding this quantum circuit with the set of
states considered initially, and by measuring the output of the circuit, one may train
the device, via classical feedback onto the parameters of the two unitary gates, in order
to maximize the output ﬁdelity with respect to the input states. This is similar to the
standard autoencoder but in a quantum scenario.
If the training is successful, then
one may discard the ﬁnal unitary gate, equivalent to the decoder, and keep only the
initial one, the encoder, therefore reducing the amount of quantum information needed
for practical applications. This could be useful, e.g., for quantum simulations [26]. An

experimental realization of the previous proposal [26] has been carried out in a quantum
photonics platform employing a three-level quantum system, a qutrit [29].

Figure 2. Scheme of a quantum autoencoder, based on the algorithms in Refs. [26, 27].
A set of input quantum states in a certain Hilbert space is encoded into a smaller
Hilbert space via a learning process. Adapted from Ref. [28].

A diﬀerent approach to quantum autoencoders was put forward in Refs. [28, 30] (see
Fig. 3). This is based on encoding the initial quantum information in a more reduced
amount of qubits via the use of approximate quantum adders. In Ref. [104], a theorem
was proven that showed that a unitary operation able to add two unknown quantum
states is forbidden by the laws of quantum physics (see also Ref. [105]). Nevertheless,
this paper deﬁned approximate quantum adders optimized according to diverse prespeciﬁed criteria. In Ref. [49], an optimization of approximate quantum adders based
on genetic algorithms, a kind of machine learning algorithm, was realized. Subsequently,
Ref. [28] developed a proposal for a quantum autoencoder based on the quantum adders
optimized in Ref. [49]. Finally, Ref. [30] implemented the previous proposal in the
Rigetti cloud quantum computer, showing its feasibility.

Finally, another kind of autoencoders in the quantum realm has been proposed and
implemented in the same article [31], namely, variational quantum autoencoders, which
describe generative models implemented via quantum Boltzmann machines [41].

3. Quantum biomimetics

Quantum biomimetics is the ﬁeld that aims at connecting other two previously
disconnected research areas such as quantum technologies and biological systems [81, 83].
This has links to quantum machine learning in areas such as, e.g., quantum neural
networks, which are also biomimetic systems. Quantum artiﬁcial life is a ﬁeld inside
quantum biomimetics in which the objective is to design quantum individuals that can
self-replicate in a quantum way, namely, in a compatible manner with the no-cloning
theorem [84, 85, 86, 87]. A second ﬁeld in quantum biomimetics is the one called
quantum memristors [93, 94, 95, 96]. These are inspired in the classical memristor,

ﬁdelity, via an approximate quantum adder operation. Adapted from Ref. [28].

the fourth element in electronic engineering in addition to the resistor, capacitor, and
inductor [97]. A classical memristor can process information at the same time as having
a memory, and may provide a novel paradigm for computing, with a neuromorphic
architecture. Equivalently, quantum memristors constitute a basic building block for a
neuromorphic quantum processor.

In this Section, we will ﬁrst revise the topic of quantum artiﬁcial life, beginning
with theoretical works [84, 85] and ﬁnishing with an experimental implementation in
the IBM cloud quantum computer [86].

Later on, we will describe the topic of quantum memristors, according to a series

of results in the literature [93, 94, 95, 96].

3.1. Quantum artiﬁcial life

Artiﬁcial life is a research ﬁeld that aims to reproduce biological properties common
to living systems in artiﬁcially engineered systems [81, 82]. Some examples are selfassembling robots [106], self-replicating chemicals [107] or computing programs [108],
as well as living neurons grown in the lab and connected to external devices [109].
One of the main areas inside this thriving ﬁeld is the self-replicating systems. Living
systems acquire complexity and structure via Darwinian evolution, or natural selection,
and this is a combination of self-replication, introduction of variability via mutations
as well as genome exchange, and selection of the ﬁttest. Therefore, self-replication is
In the research line of quantum artiﬁcial life, a series
one of the hallmarks of life.
of works has explored the possibility for elementary quantum systems to undergo selfreplication [84, 85, 86] . This is a non-trivial issue given that the no-cloning theorem [87]
prevents the perfect copying of unknown quantum states. Thus, perfect self-replication
onto distinct progeny individuals would not be allowed. What these works show is that
the full quantum information can be faithfully transferred to the progeny individuals,

under ideal conditions, if one maps the classical information of the diagonal elements of
the parent density matrix onto the diﬀerent progeny systems. On the other hand, the
coherences of the parent density matrix would be mapped onto quantum correlations
of the progeny systems. Therefore, entanglement plays a crucial role in the context of
having self-replicating quantum systems.

Figure 4. Scheme for quantum artiﬁcial life. A quantum living unit, or quantum
individual, is created from two qubits, which constitute the genotype and phenotype.
The phenotype then decoheres when coupled with a quantum reservoir, until producing
the “death” of the quantum individual. While still “alive”, the quantum individual can
undergo self-replication, via coupling with further ancillary qubits. In order to transfer
its full quantum information, the original quantum individual becomes entangled with
its progeny quantum individuals. Adapted from Ref. [85].

In Ref. [84], a ﬁrst analysis of biomimetic cloning of quantum observables was
carried out, suggesting that the full quantum information may be transferred onto
successive generations via cloning of classical
information together with controlled
transfer of quantum correlations. Later on, Ref. [85] proposed an implementation of
a model of quantum artiﬁcial life. In this model, a quantum living unit, or quantum
individual, is composed of two qubits, one for the genetic information, or genotype,
and another for the expression of the genotype in the environment, or phenotype.
The individual is created via a partial cloning operation of the genotype onto the
phenotype via a Controlled-NOT operation, a kind of entangling two-qubit quantum
gate. Subsequently, the phenotype can get coupled with a quantum reservoir, that
induces decoherence on it. After a certain amount of time, the phenotype has almost
totally decohered, and one considers that it has “died”, at least as an artiﬁcial life
individual, and according to this model. While the quantum individual is still “alive”,

10

it can couple with further ancillary qubits, carrying out additional partial cloning
operations with Controlled-NOT gates, and produce new quantum individuals, which
become entangled to the initial one, as previously explained (see Fig. 4).

Figure 5. Quantum circuit for the most complex quantum artiﬁcial life protocol
experimentally carried out in Ref. [86]. The number of two-qubit Controlled-NOT
entangling gates is of 20. H denotes a Hadamard gate, and the numbers inside the
single-qubit gates indicate diﬀerent phases, as described in Ref. [86].

In Ref. [86], a quantum implementation of the quantum artiﬁcial life model of
Ref. [85] was carried out in the IBM cloud quantum computer. Fig. 5 shows the most

ﬁdelities are not perfect, the experimental setup qualitatively reproduces the theoretical
prediction to a large extent, for an experiment of a certain complexity.

3.2. Quantum memristors

two proposals for implementations of quantum memristors in
diﬀerent quantum platforms were put forward, namely, superconducting circuits [94]
and quantum photonics [95].
In the former, the memristive behavior emerges from
quasiparticle-induced tunneling when supercurrent cancellation takes place. For realistic
parameters, the appearing hysteretic behavior may be measured using state-of-theart tomography of the phase-driven tunneling current.
In the latter, the memristive
behaviour arises from a tunable beam splitter, to which the input state is directed,
together with feedback from one of the output ports onto the beam splitter that modiﬁes
its reﬂectivity depending on the output signal.

Finally, another result has been published on some complementary devices to

quantum memristors, namely, qubit-based memcapacitors and meminductors [96].

neuromorphic quantum device. A proven speedup with respect to their classical
counterparts is still an open problem. Nevertheless, they represent a novel and promising
quantum system that may play an important role in the future in a wide variety of
scenarios as distributed quantum computing, quantum neural networks, and simulation
of non-Markovian quantum systems.

respect to its classical counterpart, as well as describe feasible experimental realizations
in controllable quantum platforms.

Quantum autoencoders are a kind of quantum machine learning protocol in which
the aim is to reduce the amount of quantum resources needed to encode a certain set of
quantum states. Via a training process, with a certain parameterized quantum circuit,
one may compress the quantum information from a certain Hilbert space onto a smaller
space of states. A further variant of quantum autoencoders proposed in the literature
is the one based on approximate quantum adders. These would allow for encoding a
certain number of quantum states on a reduced number of quantum states via previouslyoptimized approximate quantum adders. Both kinds of quantum autoencoders have
been realized experimentally. The ﬁrst one in quantum photonics, while the second one
in superconducting circuits.

Quantum artiﬁcial life is a novel paradigm inside quantum biomimetics that may
enable a quantum system to self-replicate and propagate its quantum information to
further quantum systems. An open problem that remains to be addressed in these
systems is whether one may be able to encode optimization problems by allowing the
quantum individuals to compete, in some kind of quantum Darwinian evolution.

Quantum memristors are quantum devices with processing capabilities and memory,
and constitute the basic building blocks for neuromorphic quantum computing. They
may be employed in the future for distributed quantum computing, quantum neural
networks, as well as quantum simulation of non-Markovian quantum systems.

Summarizing, quantum machine learning and quantum biomimetics are two
emerging and promising ﬁelds inside quantum technologies, which may enable a wide
variety of applications in the future.The connection between both ﬁelds is apparent
in the sense that living systems, either natural or artiﬁcial, have often the ability to
learn. With the advent of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers [110],
an enormous amount of computing power will be available, with desirable properties of
speed and low energy consumption. Only the future can tell which progress may these
technologies bring about.
