    <h1>Original text</h1>
The year of 2006 was exceptionally cruel to me – almost all of my papers submitted for that year conferences have been rejected. Not “just rejected” – unduly strong rejected. Reviewers of the ECCV (European Conference on Computer Vision) have been especially harsh: "This is a philosophical paper... However, ECCV neither has the tradition nor the forum to present such papers. Sorry..." O my Lord, how such an injustice can be tolerated in this world? However, on the other hand, it can be easily understood why those people hold their grudges against me: Yes, indeed, I always try to take a philosophical stand in all my doings: in thinking, paper writing, problem solving, and so no. In my view, philosophy is not a swear-word. Philosophy is a keen attempt to approach the problem from a more general standpoint, to see the problem from a wider perspective, and to yield, in such a way, a better comprehansion of the problem’s specificity and its interaction with other world realities. Otherwise we are doomed to plunge into the chasm of modern alchemy – to sink in partial, task-oriented determinations and restricted solution-space explorations prone to dead-ends and local traps. It is for this reason that when I started to write about “Machine Learning“, I first went to the Wikipedia to inquire: What is the best definition of the subject? “Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence“ – was the Wikipedia’s prompt answer. Okay. If so, then: “What is Artificial Intelligence?“ – “Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science which aims to create it“ – was the response. Very well. Now, the next natural question is: “What is <font class="k1">Machine Intelligence?“</font> At this point, the kindness of Wikipedia has been exhausted and I was thrown back, again to the Artificial Intelligence definition. It was embarrassing how quickly my quest had entered into a loop – a little bit confusing situation for a stubborn philosopher. Attempts to capitalize on other trustworthy sources were not much more productive (Wang, 2006; Legg &amp; Hutter, 2007). For example, Hutter in his manuscript (Legg &amp; Hutter, 2007) provides a list of 70-odd <font class="k2">“Machine Intelligence“</font> definitons. There is no consensus among the items on the list – everyone (and the citations were chosen from the works of the most prominent scholars currently active in the field), everyone has his own particular view on the subject. Such inconsistency and multiplicity of definitions is an unmistakable sign of philosophical immaturity and a lack of a will to keep the needed grade of universality and generalization. It goes without saying, that the stumbling-block of the Hutter’s list of definitions (Legg &amp; Hutter, 2007) are not the adjectives that was used – after all the terms “Artificial“ and “Machine“ are consensually close in their meaning and therefore are commonly used interchangeably. The real problem – is the elusive and indefinable term „Intelligence“. I will not try the readers’ patience and will not tediously explain how and why I had arrived at my own definition of the matters that I intend to scrutinize in this paper. I hope that my philosophical leanings will be generously excused and the benevolent readers will kindly accept the unusual (reverse) layout of the paper’s topics. For the reasons that would be explained in a little while, the main and the most general paper’s idea will be presented first while its compiling details and components will be exposed (in a discending order) afterwards. And that is how the proposed paper’s layout should look like:
- Intelligence is the system’s ability to process information. This statement is true both for all biological natural systems as for artificial, human-made systems. By <font class="k3">“information processing“</font> we do not mean its simplest forms like information storage and retrieval, information exchange and communication. What we have in mind are the high-level <font class="k4">information processing</font> abilities like information analysis and interpretation, structure patterns recognition and the system’s capacity to make decisions and to plan its own behavior. - Information in this case should be defined as a description – A language and/or an alphabet-based description, which results in a reliable reconstruction of an original object (or an event) when such a description is carried out, like an execution of a computer program. - Generally, two kinds of information must be distinguished: Objective (physical) information and subjective (semantic) information. By <font class="k5">physical information</font> information we mean the description of data structures that are discernable in a data set. By <font class="k6">semantic information</font> information we mean the description of the relationships that may exist between the physical structures of a given data set. - Machine Learning is defined as the best means for appropriate information retrieval. Its usage is endorsed by the following <font class="k7">fundamental assumptions</font> 1) Structures can be revealed by their characteristic features, 2) Feature aggregation and generalization can be achieved in a bottom-up manner where final results are compiled from the component details, 3) Rules, guiding the process of such compilation, could be learned from the data itself. - All these assumptions validating Machine Learning applications are false. (Further elaboration of the theme will be given later in the text). Meanwhile the following considerations may suffice: - <font class="k8">Physical information</font>, being a natural property of the data, can be extracted instantly from the data, and any special rules for such task accomplishment are not needed. Therefore, Machine Learning techniques are irrelevant for the purposes of <font class="k9">physical information</font> retrieval. - Unlike <font class="k10">information resources</font>, semantics is not a property of the data. Semantics is a property of an external observer that watches and scrutinizes the data. Semantics is assigned to <font class="k11">phisical data structures</font>, and therefore it can not be learned straightforwardly from the data. For this reason, Machine Learning techniques are useless and not applicable for the purposes of smantic information extraction. Semantics is a shared convention, a mutual agreement between the members of a particular group of viewers or users. Its assignment has to be done on the basis of a consensus knowledge that is shared among the group members, and which an artificial semantic-processing system has to possess at its disposal. Accomodation and fitting of this knowledge presumes availability of a different and usually overlooked special learning technique, which would be best defined as Machine Teaching – a technique that would <font class="k12">facilitate externally-prepared-knowledge</font> transfer to the system’s disposal. These are the topics that I am interested to discuss in this paper. Obviously, the reverse order proposed above, will never be reified – there are paper organization rules and requirements, which none never will be allowed to override. They must be, thus, reverently obeyed. And I earnestly promiss to do this (or at least to try to do this) in this paper.
